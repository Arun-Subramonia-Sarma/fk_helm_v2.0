Create a generic HELM chart which can be used for most of the use case which follows the following rules
I should be able to create any workload including: deployment, statefuleset, job, cronjob, deaomnset and argorollouts
Workload should be inputed from the value and defaulted in values.yaml
I should be able to create multiple job and cronjob in the same helm chart and each should use its own properties.
All other workloads should be created only once per the helm chart
The pod temapltes should be reused
Jobs and Cronjob should be able reuse the same pod temaplate
In case of multiple jobs or single job, I should be able to perform it through the same template and there is no need to have individual temaplate created for multiple jobs and for the single job
I shold be able to add properties like bu, project, application and env as label to all the workloads and the pods and these properties needed be part of pod selectors
In case of the multiple job each job should have the additional label jobname or for event cronjob, it shoould be jobname
I should be able add additional labels and annotation at workloads and for the pods apart from the common annotation and labels
I should be able to have multiple services, configmaps and secrets to be created by the helm
I should have ibgress to support multiple urls and multiple paths with in the url
The environment variables that are added in values files with be in format key=value which needed to be translated to name="key" and value="value"
I should be also able to add provision for values-from for the environment variable
The secrets are loaded in the following format

I should be able to create multiple ingress with the following structure
ingress:
  # labels:
  #   testlabel-1: value1
  # labels_active:
  #   testlabel-active-1: value1
  # labels_preview:
  #   testlabel-preview-1: value1
  # annotations:
  #   testannotation-1: value1
  # annotations_active:
  #   testannotation-active-1: value1
  # annotations_preview:
  #   testannotation-preview-1: value1
  data:
    fk-ingress:
      enabled: true
      # labels:
      #   test-fk-ingress-label: value1
      # labels-preview:
      #   test-fk-ingress-label: value1
      # labels-active:
      #   test-fk-ingress-label: value1
      annotations:
        appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/request-timeout: "120"
      annotations_active:
        appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/appgw-ssl-certificate: wildcard-fourkites-ssl
      annotations_preview:
        appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/appgw-ssl-certificate: ng-fourkites-com-wildcard-cert
      className: "azure-application-gateway"
      hosts:
        - host: dy.fourkites.com
          host_preview: dy-preview.ng.fourkites.com
          paths:
            - path: /api/*
              pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            - path: /auth/*
              pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            - path: /tms/*
              pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            - path: /gate/*
              pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            - path: /wms/*
              pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            - path: /occupancy/*
              pathType: ImplementationSpecific
Where in case of host_preview is present, then there are two ingress will be create one regular and the other with suffix preview. The labels and annotations for the preview are specified using
